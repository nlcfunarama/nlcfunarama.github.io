Packing for <b>Funarama 2020 - The Mystery at Funarama</b> is a lot like packing for any other camp; you'll still need to bring your sleeping bag and foam/air mattress, you'll still need to bring a few changes of clothes, and you'll definitely need to bring appropriate outerwear for spending a few hours outdoors! At the same time, remember that you'll be sharing space at the <a href="https://www.edmonton-ots.com/">Oilfield Technical Society</a> with 200 other Cub Scouts, plus their Scouters, so you'll want to pack as efficiently as you can.

And, of course, <strong>please do not bring in your own food*, snacks, or electronic devices</strong>.

<i>* The one exception is if you have special dietary needs that the organizers are unable to fully accommodate. But in this case, you won't be keeping any food with you where your sleeping bag is set up.</i>
