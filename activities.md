There are two signature activities at Funarama, namely the Kub Kar and Chucksled races. The winners of these activities will have their group names engraved on the Funarama trophies.

Each Cub is required to bring a newly designed Kub Kar to the camp to race against the other Cubs. Scouters may also bring a Kub Kar to race in the Scouter race. The Kub Kars are to be turned in at the registration desk upon arrival at camp. This will ensure that no Kub Kars are played with or damaged before the races begin Saturday. It also maximizes the amount of time the volunteers have to verify the Kub Kars are compliant for weight and size limitations. Non-compliant Kars will only be permitted to be part of the design competition. All cars must be road worthy to be considered in the design competition.

There will be no tools on site to modify Kub Kars. Please ensure they are compliant before they arrive at camp.

There are trophies available for the 4 fastest Kub Kars as well as the top 3 designs, as voted by the youth. The youth will vote for their favorite Kub Kar design by placing their lanyard in the bin next to their preferred Kub Kar on Sunday. The Kars that accumulate the most lanyards will be deemed the winners. Each participant will have 1 vote.

Chucksled races will be conducted in outfits (teams) of 8 Cubs. Should you not have a full team of 8, Cubs from other groups will be joined together to form a team. Groups are able to create multiple teams if they have enough participants and provided that no individual Cub races with more than one team.

If your group does not have a chucksled, they can borrow one from another group. Each group however, must have one helmet for use by the group’s “Cook” while they ride on the chucksled. This is for safety reasons.
Chucksleds are to be permanently fastened together.

The Friday night scavenger hunt is designed to allow participants to join the activity as they arrive and register. It is not imperative that all Cubs be present at 6:30pm in order to participate.

A Scouter from each group must be present before any youth from that group will be permitted to move past the registration table.

## Outdoor Activities - Be Prepared!

Invariably, some youth will arrive at camp without the appropriate cold weather gear. Please ensure that your group has some additional cold weather gear (mitts, toque and socks) to assist with any youth from your pack that are inadequately equipped. The camp has no provision for inadequately attired youth to remain indoors while their group is participating in an outdoor activity. February mornings can be very cold in Alberta.

## Activity Groups

Each registered participant will be provided a coloured lanyard. The colour of the ID card holder will designate the Saturday rotation group. The lanyards will be randomly assigned and distributed across the Cubs and Scouters in each pack. The lanyards are to be worn throughout the weekend. These are used for security purposes to identify who belongs and who does not belong at camp.

Red, Green, Yellow and Blue ID card holders will designate the rotation groups.

The lanyards double as ballots for Kub Kar design. This doubles as a way to ensure that lanyards are returned to the organizing committee. In the event a participant must leave early, please return the lanyard to any member of the organizing committee.

## Badge Trading

Badge trading will be before supper Saturday night. Let your Cubs know to bring some badges to trade. This is not mandatory, but is encouraged. Standard Scouts Canada rules will apply to all badge trading.

<ul>
<li>All badge trades must be 1 for 1.</li>
<li>Both parties must agree on the trade.</li>
<li>You can say no, if they are not comfortable with the trade.</li>

</ul>

## Campfire - Saturday Night

Campfire will be held inside the OTS pavilion utilizing an indoor fire. Each Pack is expected to bring a skit or song, and a cheer with them. They WILL be called upon to perform their skit or song, and their cheer. Be prepared. Your Pack’s campfire skit or song and cheer needs to be ready and handed in at the Friday night meeting.
