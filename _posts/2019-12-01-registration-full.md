When we opened up registrations for <b>Funarama 2020 - The Mystery at Funarama</b>, we set a limit of 200 people (Cubs and Scouters). As of this week, we are just about at that limit; there are about five open spots left.

What this means, in practical terms, is that if more than five more registrations are submitted, we will put the sixth through infinitieth registrants onto a waitlist. We will also begin enforcing the deadline to submit camp fees. So: if you've already submitted a registration, please ensure that your camp fees get submitted with all due haste. And, if you haven't yet submitted a registration, please consider doing so; we are exploring whether we can increase the camp's capacity.
