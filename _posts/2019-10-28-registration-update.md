Welcome to the redesigned website for <b>Funarama 2020 - The Mystery at Funarama</b>, the annual winter camp for Cub Scouts in Alberta and Western Saskatchewan. Please bear with us as we bring the site fully online; over the next week or so, you can expect to see its pages get a little more populated.

This year, <b>Funarama 2020 - The Mystery at Funarama</b> is being hosted by the 59th Edmonton Scout Group, with assistance from a few other groups in the Edmonton region. You can find out more details about the "when" and the "where" of the camp over on the <a href="../../../forms.html">Registration and Forms</a> page.

## Registration Date

Registration for <b>Funarama 2020 - The Mystery at Funarama</b> will open, assuming everything goes to plan, on November 1st, 2019. That's this week! Registration will be limited to 200 participants (plus Scouters, parent helpers, and adult volunteers), and we expect that all 200 spots will go rather quickly, so watch this site over the days to come!
