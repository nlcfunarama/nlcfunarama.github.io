Registration for <b>Funarama 2020 - The Mystery at Funarama</b> has been open for only a week so far, and the camp is already over half full! As of Thursday, we had 108 registered participants; the registration cap is set at 200. That's a pretty impressive first week, if I do say so myself, and it's heartening to see that there continues to be real enthusiasm for <b>Funarama</b>.

We are looking forward to seeing everyone there!
