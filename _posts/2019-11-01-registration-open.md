## Registration Now Open!

Registration for <b>Funarama 2020 - The Mystery at Funarama</b> is now officially open. Head on over to  the <a href="../../../forms.html">Registration and Forms</a> page to find a link to the online registration form.

A few notes about how we are handling online registration:

<ul>
<li>Google Forms is the underlying technology.</li>
<li>Groups are able to submit pertinent data online (e.g. name of group, number of Cubs attending, number of Scouters attending, etc.).</li>
<li>Groups are able to edit this information at a later date.</li>
<li>Registration fee payments are not being processed online.</li>
</ul>

Registration is open to the first 200 participants. When a group submits their registration using the online form, we will hold the number of participant spots specified for a duration of two (2) weeks, with the expectation that camp fees will be paid within that two week window. Unpaid participant spots may be released after the two week period, if there is a need to free up capacity for other interested groups.

In the weeks to come, we will be posting additional information to the site (e.g. the rules for chucksled races), and also kicking off a crest design contest. So please stay tuned, both here and on Slack. (And if you aren't on the Slack channel yet, send us a message via the contact form on the main page of the site, and we will send you an invite!)
