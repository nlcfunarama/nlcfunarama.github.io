title: Less Than 24 Hours Until Funarama Begins!

It's late on Thursday (February 6th) evening as I'm typing this; the night before <b>Funarama</b>. The eve of <b>Funarama</b>, as the older way of saying it would go. In less than 24 hours, Cub Scouts, Scouters, and Offers of Service will descend on the <b>Oilfield Technical Society</b>, to take part in a variety of indoor and outdoor activities, and to hopefully have an absolute blast.

In a change from previous years, the weather forecast is looking rather favourable; Alberta went through its precipitous cold snap earlier this year than has been the norm over the last few years; the days of -40 C (and below!) seem to be well behind us. There was still an outdoor element to the <b>Funarama</b> program during those other years, of course, but we can do -- we expect to do -- much more with the Cubs this year in terms of getting them out into the snow. A high of -5 C (that's what the forecast for Saturday is, currently) is much better than a high of -35 C!

I look forward to seeing everyone at camp!
