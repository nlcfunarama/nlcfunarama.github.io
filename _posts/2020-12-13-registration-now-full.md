Registrations for <b>Funarama 2020 - The Mystery at Funarama</b> are now full; thank you everyone for your interest in this camp.

If you've submitted a registration form -- that is, we know how many people you are bringing -- but have not yet submitted a cheque, please do so as soon as possible; the camp is accumulating a waitlist, and we will free up "past due" spots to accommodate this additional interest if need be.

Additionally, in looking at registrations, we have noticed that several groups have submitted a global list of allergies experienced by the contingent they will be bringing to camp. However, we know from experience that individuals can often manifest multiple allergies. We will be reaching out to these groups to further clarify allergy details (e.g. who has which allergies, how many people have a particular allergies, etc.) as we plan the meals for the camp.
